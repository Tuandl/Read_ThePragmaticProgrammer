- `dead reckoning`: a method to calculate the current position based on a known position.
- `fleshed out`: to make something complete by adding more information, details.
- `augment`: increase size or value of something by adding something to it.

## Tracer bullets
Tracer bullets are glow bullets. When they are fired, we can see the bullet trajectory to know if we shoot to right direction or to let the team members know we should focus on that direction. This analogy can be applied into software engineering discipline, that force us to build towards the deliverable target in order to demo as soon as possible, to gather buy-in, gather requirement changes, then fulfill the missing feature later.

### Code that glows in the dark
> Look for the important requirements, the ones that define the system. Look for the areas where you have doubts, and where you see the biggest risks. Then prioritize your development so that these are the first areas you code.

Benefit of the tracer bullet development: you have a better feel for progress. Because each individual development is smaller, you avoid creating those monolithic blocks of code that are reported as 95% complete week after week.

### Tracer code vs Prototyping
You might think that this Tracer code concept is nothing more than prototyping under an aggressive name.
Prototyping is disposable, while Tracer code is the actual implementation. When we do tracer code, we genuinely implement the actual code with the target building MVP feature so that we know how the application as a whole hang together. You want to know how the user interaction will work in practice and you give developers an architectural skeleton on which to hang code.
