## Introduction
When having a finest idea or the most pragmatic thinking is ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with other people. A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.
To practice advocating your ideas, let's treat English as another programming languages, write natural language as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, ETC, automation, and so on.

> English is just another programming language

Ideas that would be useful:

#### Know your audience

> The meaning of your communication is the response you get
> A core presuppositions of NLP

The trick to make effective communication with the target audience is gathering feedback. Don't just wait for them, ask for them. The presumption of NLP above highlights the true meaning of the message is not what was intended, but rather the what receivers response to and understand. This also highlight the important of feedback in the communication.

#### Know what you want to say
> Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them?" Refine until it does.

#### Choose your moment
Choose the time when the audient is willing to be a receptive listener to share the idea.

#### Choose a style
It's more suitable when asking the audience the style they wanted or let them know the style you wanted, too. Because you're only a half of the communication transaction.

#### Make it look good
> After awl, their are spelling miss streaks that the chequer can knot ketch.

That means: "After all, their are spelling mistake that the checker can not catch". This is an important practice, that we should use automatic tool first, then by hand.

#### Involve your audience
The process to produce the document is more important than the document itself. It's better to get feedbacks from the audiences.

#### Be a listener
A technique to make people listen to you is listen to them. We can ask the meeting participants to restate the discussion in their own words to turn the meeting into a dialog.

#### Get back to people
> It's both what you say and the way you say it

Always response to the email / voicemails, at lease tell them "I'll get back to you later" to making people more forgiving of the occasional split.

#### Documentation
We can documenting inside the source code to be as close as possible.
When documenting inside the source code, we might violate DRY principle because we might explain what function does while the code itself already explained. Therefore restrict your non-API commenting to discuss **why** something is done.

## Summary
After reading this chapter, next time, when you write an email, discuss something, let's specify the target audience, maybe try to ask them for feedback to know if our communication is effective.
